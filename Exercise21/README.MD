You must create an html with a container of container type and add rows and columns imitating the design and
colors of the following schemes.
In the diagram of the figure you can see 3 dispositions of the same web, that of Left for large sizes (lg) and averages (md), the central for small screens or tablets (sm), and the one on the right corresponding to mobiles (xs). You must apply the classes from
Bootstrap needed to change the size of the screen, change the layout of blogs. Note that the red column disappears in size xs.
